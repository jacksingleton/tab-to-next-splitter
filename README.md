tab-to-next-splitter
====================

IntelliJ plugin to move the current editor tab to the next splitter window (with the keyboard)

This seems to currently only be possible by dragging a tab from one splitter pane to another
using the mouse, making split pane mode very inconvenient.

Default key binding is 'shift alt tab'
